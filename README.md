# SOC---Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection-system
This is my final project of SOC in which i have deployed my model.

For this project, i have used PYTHON, ML, DL, OPENCV, COMPUTER VISION, FLASK and web development tools like HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and basic JAVASCRIPT.

This is a real time drowsiness detection system, which detects if the person is sleepy or awake by taking input from the webcam. We use image processing and Deep Learning(computer vision) in this project to identify the sleep and active mode. I had trained my model by giving it MRL dataset.

The model works well and gives a beep sound when it detects a closed eye. Model also has taken into consideration the blink of the driver and doesn't beep when blinked.
